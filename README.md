<h2>Halal_Food_Detector</h2>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The aim of this project is to develop an Optical Capture Recognition (OCR) for
Android based mobile devices. As now-a-days many foods item are imported that may 
contain ingredients that are not halal. So we came up with idea to scan the product ingredients 
and tell its contents are halal or not. In this project user will give image and then that image 
will be converted to text then we will check that which ingredients are halal based on the 
dataset of halal ingredients in our database, so it will filter out haram content. We will also 
train our model so that based on ingredients tell the allergies. Libraries we will try to use are 
OpenCV, pandas, Numpy, and pyTorch. We will use AI deep learning algorithms such as 
Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional neural network to extract data from image of 
ingredients and for training of dataset to point out allergies. We will get dataset from Kaggle</p>



<h3>Product Description:</h3>

In this we have used Optical Character Recognition with Neural Network. Our work starts with the acquisition 
of a given image and then scanning the given image for editing and producing desirable outputs. We then 
pre-processed our images and applied segmentation on it so that the text could be separated. After this the features 
of the image were extracted which were then followed by recognition and classification.

<ul>
<li> Our model supports both techniques i.e. reading e-code and reading ingredients to tell if it is halal or not</li>
<li> Moreover, Our model also tells about possible allergies which the ingredient in that food content could cause.
This is something different which we added in our model for user convenience</li>
<li> Our future goal is to display all the nearby stores where you can get halal food easily</li>
</ul>



<h3>Technology:</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Java as an object oriented programming language</li>
<li>  Android SDK( Software development Kit)</li>
<li>  Android Studio</li>
<li>  ML-Kit </li> 
<li>  XML </li> 
</ul>
